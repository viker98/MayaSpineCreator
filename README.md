# MayaSpineCreator
## Introduction
This is a Spine Rigging Tool I developed as the final for my Technical Direction Class in College
## Install
To install the program into your maya all you have to do it unzip the files and then inside of the extracted files just drag the "install.mell" file into the viewport of maya and it should appear on the shelf with a spine icon.

## Instructions
when you click the new icon in your shelf you should get a widget that looks like this

After this just follow these Steps

* Part 1: Select the Root joint and then click the first button on top of the widget
* Part 2: then you will specify how many spine joint you have in your rig (Note: you would not count your root joint in this number)
* Part 3: after putting how many spine joins you have on your rig you will then click the "Auto Find jnts" button and it will then find the rest of your spine joints
* Part 4: And Lastly after doing all of the previous step you just click the Rig Spine button and it will well... rig the spine

## Troubleshooting
I have tested this a lot and it should work however nothing is perfect so here is some troubleshooting methods.

If you are having a problem with controls now showing up on joint parts their is mutiple things you could test.
* First I would check if you put the right amount of spine joint pieces
* if you are 100% sure about that after clicking the "Select Root and Press Here" and "Auto Find Jnts" button it should display what it believes all of those pieces should be make sure that all of those joints are the correct things

## Conclusion
* this was a fun project to make and if you have any question at all about it fill free to email me about anything
